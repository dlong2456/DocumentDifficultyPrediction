# DocumentDifficultyPrediction

I am developing this tool as part of a Computer Science honors thesis project at UNC-Chapel Hill. The goal of this project is to develop a tool that predicts when ESL students composing essays in text editors (specifically Google Docs) are facing language-related difficulty. This is an extension of a current project that makes similar predictions for students who are programming in Eclipse (see Github repository EclipseHelper).
